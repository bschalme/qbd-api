# QBD API

An API for QuickBooks Desktop (QBD). This uses the MySQL database created by Synergration's [OpenSync])http://synergration.com/software/opensync/) as its backing datastore. You simply issue REST-ful HTTP calls against QBD and it will persist the data.

Of course, you will need OpenSync running and a licensed copy of QuickBooks Desktop to synchronize the MySQL database with QuickBooks.
